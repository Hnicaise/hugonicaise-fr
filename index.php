                        <p class=>Hello! My name is Hugo Nicaise. I'm a web developer and audiovisual student in the city of Troyes, France. I started to create websites back in 2014 by curiosity to help my father, but since I never stopped. Beside my studies, I create websites and digital projects for professionals and individuals. I also create personal projects to keep on learning every single day because I love my job.</p>

                        <h2>My studies</h2>
                        <p>Back in 2015, I passed a science and mechanic baccalaureate. Right after it, I started a degree in computer science which didn't satisfy me. So, in 2017 I applied to a web development and audiovisual degree which learned me a lot. Now in 2019, I'm beginning a professional certificate in front and back development.</p>
